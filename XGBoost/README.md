# [XGBoost - eXtreme Gradient Boosting]( https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)


XGBoost is an optimized distributed gradient boost library designed to be highly efficient, flexible and portable. It implements algorithms machine learning under the Gradient Boosting framework. XGBoost provides a parallel tree augmentation (aka GBDT, GBM) that solves many Data Science problems quickly and accurately. The same code runs in the distributed environment (Hadoop, SGE, MPI) and can solve problems with data from billions of records.
